# [JSL10] Submission: Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge

# Project Overview
- The Escape Vanilla JS Challenge is an interactive web-based project focusing on debugging skills, problem-solving, and the concept of abstraction. I had to navigate through three themed "rooms," each which presented a unique challenge that required me to debug them and provide the correct given JavaScript code to proceed. This adventure was themed around escaping the confines of Vanilla JavaScript to advance towards learning React.

# Elements Included
- Code that includes the necessary modifications to meet the project requirements.
- GitHub repository that contains the updated code files.

# Reflections 
## Areas of Mastery 
- There aren't any areas of mastery that I would highlight in this project but I added comments throughout the code to explain sections and functions that I did not understand which I believe will help me to better understand the purpose and functionality of those different parts.

## Challenges faced
- Using the correct syntax when I had to debug the asynchronous function
- Using the array.prototype.filter() method in order to display a new array that only display the common concepts between the two sets.

## Areas of Improvement
- I would like to improve on using the 'await' keyword and using the correct syntax associated with it.
- Be more familiar with the array.prototype.filter() method.
- Be able to differentiate between .innerHTML and .textContent as it is still confusing me.
- Debugging more asynchronous functions.

# Overall Learning Expirience 
- Throughout this project I believe I gained hands-on experience working with Promises, async/await, and fetching data from a JSON file. I'm glad I got to manipulate arrays and sets to find common elements between them. I got to identify potential errors and debug them by researching the error and I believe this helped in developing debugging skills. It was a bit frustrating at times but I'm glad I was able to overcome those challenges and learn from them.
